# WnCC-Recruitment-Assignment
Task 1:
I have used a very simple algorithm that first, I attended all the sessions which were 1 hour long, and then recursively check all the longer slots. If there are no shoter slots booked in the longer slot, then attend it otherwise, do not attend it.
I have made the name of the file on which you have to test the code as a command line arguement, so please provide it as like, if file name is "schedule.txt", then run the code as ./a.out schedule.txt
There is a class Schedule that stores some attributes related to the sessions and the slots that are there in the schedule. The functions are commented in the code with their functionalities.

Task 2:
It is quiet unfortunate for me as I was not able to complete this task, as I am travelling to campus on 19th and the packing of travel and all related things didn't let me complete task 2.
